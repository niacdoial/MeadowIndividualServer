# Individual (per-lobby) server for Rain Meadow.

It can be used directly to setup a world-wide "private" lobby,
reachable for both Steam-based and GOG-based players.

(However, it will need to be directly joined by its public IP/port)

It can also be started as part of a matchmaking server.

to use it, run for instance:
`MeadowIndividualServer port=8720 maxplayers=4`
